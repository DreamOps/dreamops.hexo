The Force.com platform offers developers amazing benefits and unique challenges, and it’s crazy helpful for us to meet the challenges together.

We have a dream. We want Force.com to be the most scalable, most agile, most developer-friendly platform on the planet – or in the cloud – bar none. #Together

Please join the conversation in our [Salesforce Success Community](http://www.dreamops.org/group).
